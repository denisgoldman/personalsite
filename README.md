# NUXT personal site/portfolio

## About
This is a work in progress personal site/portfolio i am building for myself.
Project is based on NUXT.JS Vue Framework with planned support for internationalization and automatic theme switching based on user browser/device theme.

## Goals
My main goals with this project is to check NUXT and Vue out as well as create a personal portfolio. Another important aspects are simplicity, performance, pleasing design, great UX for mobile devices and decent support for older browsers (like IE11).

## Build Setup and Startup

$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
