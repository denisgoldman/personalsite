# NUXT personal site/portfolio

This is a work in progress personal site/portfolio i am building for myself.
Project is based on NUXT.JS Vue Framework with planned support for internationalization and automatic theme switching based on user browser/device theme.

## Build Setup and Startup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
